# About

I am a senior at Tufts University double majoring in quantitative economics and political science. I am currently looking for opportunities to work in quantitative economic and social research, with the goal of eventually pursuing graduate education in the social sciences. I created this website to share writing samples from my courses, independent research, and student journalism. 

When I'm not busy with academics, I spend my time reading, editing for the [Tufts Daily](https://tuftsdaily.com), volunteering with [Bluebonnet Data](https://www.bluebonnetdata.org/), or stumbling my way through foreign languages.

### Using instrumental variables to estimate long-term effects of highway construction

In this paper I develop a model that predicts negative consequences for a community's social mobility when highways are constructed nearby. I test it on [Opportunity Insights data](https://opportunityinsights.org/data/), and as an instrumental variable I use the 1947 highway plan that [Baum-Snow (2007)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/122/2/775/1942140?redirectedFrom=fulltext) identifies as an exogenous source of variation in highway construction.

### Applying a multilevel model to predict attitudes toward homosexuality

This paper was written as the final assignment for my Applied Multilevel Analysis course at the University of TÃ¼bingen. Using data from the [European Social Survey](https://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/), I model the relationship between religiosity and hostility toward homosexuality; to accomplish this I use a random slopes model that accounts for the significant variation between countries and allows me to model contextual effects. The paper includes visualizations of how European countries vary in their survey responses, as well as technical assessments of how to interpret model's variance components and residual distribution.

### Features for the Tufts Daily

Though most of my student journalism work has been without a byline, either as a copy editor or writing editorials, linked below are two of my contributions to the Tufts Daily's features section.

[Music and activism converge at HONK! festival](https://tuftsdaily.com/features/2019/10/15/music-activism-converge-honk-festival/)

[For remote first-years, a different start to college](https://tuftsdaily.com/features/2020/09/25/for-remote-first-years-a-different-start-to-college/)

### Tufts Public Opinion Lab blog

In this contribution to the Tufts Public Opinion Lab blog, I use data from the 2020 Cooperative Election Study to explore variance in the levels of civic engagement shown by different religious groups. I visualize these difference across religious groups and across varying levels of church attendance.
