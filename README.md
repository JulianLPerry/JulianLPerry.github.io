# About

I am a senior at Tufts University double majoring in quantitative economics and political science. I am currently looking for opportunities to work in quantitative economic and social research, with the goal of eventually pursuing graduate education in the social sciences.

My research interests lie in the application of quantitative methods to understand issues of political economy. These include housing policy, energy policy, transit policy, and more broadly, how to achieve the equitable provision of public goods. Throughout my undergraduate studies I have sought out all available opportunities to study quantitative methods in the social sciences, enrolling in both undergraduate- and graduate-level methods courses at Tufts as well as at the University of TÃ¼bingen in Germany.

When I'm not busy with academics, I spend my time reading, editing for the [Tufts Daily](https://tuftsdaily.com), volunteering with [Bluebonnet Data](https://www.bluebonnetdata.org/), or stumbling my way through foreign languages.

## Technical Writing Sample:
### Using instrumental variables to estimate long-term effects of highway construction

In this paper I develop a model that predicts negative consequences for a community's social mobility when highways are constructed nearby. I test it on [Opportunity Insights data](https://opportunityinsights.org/data/), and as an instrumental variable I use the 1947 highway plan that [Baum-Snow (2007)](https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/122/2/775/1942140?redirectedFrom=fulltext) identifies as an exogenous source of variation in highway construction.

## Journalistic Writing Samples:
### Features for the Tufts Daily

Though most of my student journalism work has been without a byline, either as a copy editor or writing editorials, linked below are two of my contributions to the Tufts Daily's features section.

[Music and activism converge at HONK! festival](https://tuftsdaily.com/features/2019/10/15/music-activism-converge-honk-festival/)

[For remote first-years, a different start to college](https://tuftsdaily.com/features/2020/09/25/for-remote-first-years-a-different-start-to-college/)

## Additional Writing Sample:
### Tufts Public Opinion Lab blog

In this contribution to the Tufts Public Opinion Lab blog, I use data from the 2020 Cooperative Election Study to explore variance in the levels of civic engagement shown by different religious groups. I visualize these difference across religious groups and across varying levels of church attendance.
