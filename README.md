## About

I am a senior at Tufts University double majoring in quantitative economics and political science. I am currently looking for opportunities to work in quantitative economic and social research, with the goal of eventually pursuing graduate education in the social sciences.

My research interests lie in the application of quantitative methods to understand issues of political economy. These include housing policy, energy policy, transit policy, and more broadly, how to achieve the equitable provision of public goods. Throughout my undergraduate studies I have sought out all available opportunities to study quantitative methods in the social sciences, enrolling in both undergraduate- and graduate-level methods courses at Tufts as well as at the University of TÃ¼bingen in Germany.

When I'm not busy with academics, I spend my time reading, editing for the [Tufts Daily](https://tuftsdaily.com), volunteering with [Bluebonnet Data](https://www.bluebonnetdata.org/), or stumbling my way through foreign languages.
